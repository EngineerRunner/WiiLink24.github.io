# WiiLink24 Website

This site is generated by [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com), a Ruby-based static site generator.
It's built by GitHub and served automatically on commit.

To build and serve this website locally for testing:

1. Install [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/). Typically, the latest version is what you want to install.
2. Ensure `bundle`, a dependency management system for Ruby, is installed by running `gem install bundler`.
3. Run `bundle install` to pull in Jekyll and other dependencies.
4. You can now run `bundle exec jekyll serve`! By default, the site will be available on <http://localhost:4000>.
