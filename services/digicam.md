## Digicam arranges your beautiful photos into a masterpiece.
 - Print your perfect shots directly from your Wii.
 - Create your own design.
 - Emailed directly to you.

## {{ site.info }}
### Are photos physically mailed to me?
 - No! We use the email address you have registered via [Set Personal Data](/services/spd).
 - Your photos are rendered on our server, and a ZIP file is emailed directly to you.

### Digicam is telling me that my address is within "Dallas, TX".
 - This is the default address. Please change it via [Set Personal Data](/services/spd).

### I use Dolphin. My photos or Miis sometimes become black. What can I do?
 - Within Dolphin's graphics settings, disable the setting "Store XFB Copies to Texture Only".

### Digicam is telling me that my selected image is not supported.
 - Digicam only supports "baseline" (not "progressive", or "interlaced") JPEGs. Here are some tips to make your photo compatible:
   - Using Photoshop:
     - Go to File > Export > Save for Web (Legacy)
     - Change the format to JPEG. Make sure to uncheck 'Progressive' and 'Optimized'.
   - Using Paint.NET:
     - Go to File -> Save As...
     - Change the 'Save as type' to JPEG, and save.
     - You do not need to change any options - Paint.NET does not support progressive JPEGs, and will save as baseline.
