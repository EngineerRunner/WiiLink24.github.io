## Set Personal Data helps you use other services.

## {{ site.info }}

### A channel is informing me I need to install Set Personal Data.
 - Please follow [our installation guide]({{ site.guide }}) to use the patcher. From there, you will be able to install the Set Personal Data channel.

### What does this service do?
 - The original "Set Personal Data" channel does not work well on non-Japanese Wiis, so we made our own.
 - This allows you to set information such as your first/last name, and an email address.
 - Many other channels require it to be installed so that they can access address information.

### Set Personal Data is telling me that my address is within "Dallas, TX".
 - This is the default address. You are welcome to update it to your own!
