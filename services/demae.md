### Will the Demae Channel order real food?
 - Yes! Some current information:
   - Support has been developed for Domino's in Canada, and Deliveroo in Europe.
   - There are plans to expand more services over to Demae for other countries.
 - If this ever changes throughout development, we will **always** have fake ordering, with restaurants curated from our team!

### When Demae Channel releases, how will I pay for food?
 - The Demae Channel only supports <b>pay-on-delivery</b>, where you will have to pay in either cash or card, to the delivery driver. You cannot input your card details into the Demae Channel or Set Personal Data in any way.

### Does WiiLink save my address when using Demae Channel?
 - No, we cannot see your address. The only time we ever recieve it is when you place an order, where it is sent straight to the provider (e.g. Dominos), not us.
