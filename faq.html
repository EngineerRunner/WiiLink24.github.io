    <h2>Why WiiLink?</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>WiiLink is the only service to bring back Japanese exclusive Wii channels after they were officially shut down. We've made <b>Wii no Ma</b> and <b>Digicam Print Channel</b> functional once more, and we're hard at work on the <b>Demae Channel</b>. With our service, you can experience all of these once more on your Nintendo Wii - possibly for the first time.</li>
        <li>We have also taken ahold of Striim Network! This means that you will be able to get back exclusive streaming channels back to your Wii, such as YouTube and Kirby TV Channel.</li>
    </ul>

    <br />

    <h2>Why does WiiLink exist?</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Without a replacement service for these Japanese and Streaming channels, they would be lost to time, never to be seen again. However, thanks to our work, future generations of players can experience these channels again!</li>
    </ul>

    <br />

    <h2>Is using WiiLink legal?</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Absolutely. We develop all of our channels without copyrighted code and material, and rely solely on what is provided within the channel and public knowledge. All code is written from the ground up. You will have no legal trouble from using our service.</li>
    </ul>

    <br />

    <h2>Will the Demae Channel order real food?</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Yes! There is already tested support for Domino's in Canada, and Deliveroo in Europe. There are plans to expand more services over to Demae for other countries.</li>
        <li>Incase something changes along the line, we will <b>always</b> have fake ordering, with some restaurants from our team!</li>
    </ul>

    <br />

    <h2>How do I install WiiLink on my Wii or Wii U?</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>For this, you'll want to check out our page on <a href="https://wii.guide/wiilink24">Wii.Guide</a> (<a href="https://wii.guide/kirby-tv">Striim Network</a>), with simple, easy to follow instructions that are straight to the point for installing to your system.</li>
    </ul>

    <br />

    <h2>How do I update WiiLink?</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Updating WiiLink channels is the exact same as installing! You will want to use the WiiLink/Striim patcher and install the WADs that they give you.</li>
    </ul>

    <br />

    <h2>Is your service open source?</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Yes! Our repositories are hosted on Github: <a href="https://github.com/WiiLink24">https://github.com/WiiLink24</a></li>
    </ul>

    <br />

    <h2>Is your service a replacement for RiiConnect24?</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>No! This service is designed to be a companion to RiiConnect24, providing exclusive Japanese and streaming services, though some channels will be able to replace them (such as Mii Contest Channel and Everybody Votes Channel)</li>
    </ul>
